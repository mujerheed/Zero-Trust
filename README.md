# Project Proposal: Zero Trust Security for Informal E-Commerce in Nigeria
---
## 1.0 Executive Summary
This proposal outlines the design and implementation of a Zero Trust Security System to address critical vulnerabilities in Nigeria's informal e-commerce sector. The project targets the fraud and security weaknesses prevalent in social media-based commerce, where transactions rely on an implicit, insecure trust model. By adopting a "never trust, always verify" approach, this system will provide a robust framework for transaction verification, role-based access control, and data privacy, ultimately fostering a more secure and trustworthy environment for both vendors and buyers.

## 2.0 Problem Statement
Informal e-commerce in Nigeria, primarily conducted through social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, is growing rapidly but remains highly vulnerable to fraud and weak transaction security. Unlike formal online marketplaces, these platforms lack built-in safeguards for buyer and seller verification, payment confirmation, and secure data handling.

Currently, transactions rely on trust-based interactions: buyers place orders through direct messages, transfer funds via mobile banking, and share proof of payment using screenshots or SMS alerts. This process is highly susceptible to fraud, as screenshots and receipts can be easily forged or manipulated. Vendors, in turn, risk delivering products without receiving genuine payment, while buyers face the threat of transacting with fraudulent vendors.

Beyond receipt forgery, several structural security gaps exist:

- *Reliance on trust-based interactions*: Without verification mechanisms.

- *Fraudulent buyers*: Submitting forged receipts as proof of payment.

- *Weak Payment Verification*: Vendors lacking tools to verify payment authenticity without banking apps or APIs.

- Absence of Role-Based Access Control: Sensitive actions, such as approving high-value transactions, lack segregation of duties or privileged access management.

- No Escalation for High-Value Transactions: Transactions above a certain threshold expose vendors to higher risks, yet there is no system for multi-level approval.

- Insecure Data Handling: Sensitive customer information (e.g., full name, phone number, delivery address) is collected and stored without a structured security framework, creating risks of breaches or misuse.

Implicit Trust Model: The current workflow assumes trust, which contradicts modern security principles.

These weaknesses result in financial fraud, loss of trust, reputational damage, and exposure of sensitive data within Nigeria’s social-media-driven commerce ecosystem.

## 3.0 Project Objectives
This project seeks to:

1. Implement alphanumeric OTP-based buyer verification using SMS, WhatsApp, or Email.

2. Enable secure order and receipt handling, with encrypted cloud storage.

3. Apply role-based access control (RBAC) for buyers, vendors, and administrators.

4. Establish high-value transaction escalation using a digit-based OTP for approvals.

5. Develop a secure vendor/admin dashboard for transaction management.

6. Integrate Zero Trust principles (sessionless security, least privilege, continuous verification).

7. Ensure ease of adoption by leveraging existing communication platforms without requiring buyers to install new apps.

## 4.0 Methodology
The project proposes the design and implementation of a Zero Trust Security System tailored to informal e-commerce. The system will adopt a “never trust, always verify” approach, ensuring that every transaction step requires authentication and verification. The solution will be a serverless, cloud-native application hosted on AWS, designed to integrate with existing communication channels.

The project will follow this methodology:

System Design & Architecture: Design a Zero Trust-based workflow and an AWS architecture (Cognito, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS).

Backend Development (Python, AWS Lambda): Implement the core logic for OTP generation, validation, receipt upload, storage, and access control.

Frontend Development (HTML/React): Create a secure, role-based dashboard for vendors and administrators to manage transactions and approvals.

Security Integration: Implement encryption of data in transit (TLS) and at rest (S3 encryption), enforce OTP expiry, and apply IAM role-based access controls.

Testing & Evaluation: Conduct functional and security testing to ensure the system works as intended, with a focus on access control, data privacy, and fraud simulation.

## 5.0 Scope and Limitations
Scope
The project will focus on:

Designing and implementing a cloud-based security system using AWS.

Developing a Python-powered backend for OTP generation, receipt verification, and access control.

Creating a web dashboard for vendors and administrators.

Integrating with existing communication channels (e.g., WhatsApp Business API or SMS gateways).

Applying audit logging, monitoring, and encryption for compliance and accountability.

Limitations
Full automation of receipt verification depends on bank API availability, which may not be universally accessible.

The system relies on stable internet connectivity for OTP delivery and cloud functions.

Initial deployment is targeted at small-to-medium vendors; scaling may require additional cloud optimizations.

Buyers must have access to existing communication channels (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) for OTPs.

## 6.0 Technology Stack
Cloud Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Programming Language: Python

Core AWS Services: AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, AWS API Gateway, Amazon SageMaker / Amazon Textract, Amazon Cognito, and AWS IAM.

## 7.0 Project Plan & Milestones
The project will be executed in a phased approach, with key milestones defined for each module.

Module 1: Foundational Services & OTP Generation: Establish the cloud infrastructure and develop the core Python function for OTP generation and secure storage.

Module 2: Transaction Verification & Bot Integration: Build the secure API gateway and backend logic for OTP-based transaction verification. Integrate with a social media bot.

Module 3: Advanced Fraud Detection: Leverage AI services like Amazon SageMaker or Amazon Textract to build a system for automated receipt validation.

Module 4: The CEO Dashboard: Implement a secure, role-based web dashboard for high-level transaction oversight and approval.

## 8.0 Expected Deliverables
System Architecture Diagram (AWS-based Zero Trust design).

Python backend code (OTP, Lambda functions, receipt validation).

Vendor/Admin dashboard (HTML/React).

IAM Policies and S3 bucket configurations for least-privilege access.

Audit logging and monitoring setup via AWS CloudWatch.

Documentation & GitHub repository (with project structure, README, and usage guide).

## 9.0 Significance of the Study
This project will provide a secure, practical, and scalable model for improving trust in Nigeria’s informal e-commerce sector. By embedding Zero Trust principles, it protects vendors from fraud, secures customer data, and establishes accountability for sensitive financial transactions. Beyond Nigeria, this solution offers a replicable framework for other countries with similar informal commerce ecosystems.
